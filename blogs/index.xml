      <description>A Promising Newcomer As a promising newcomer of the cloud native family, KubeSphere has gained widespread recognition among its users and developers since it joined the open source community nearly two years ago. This article illustrates the position and value of KubeSphere from scratch in a straightforward way and sheds light on why different teams have chosen KubeSphere.
For Enterprises KubeSphere is a multi-tenant container platform built on Kubernetes with applications at its core.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Kubernetes Control Plane In a Kubernetes cluster, there are two machines roles including master nodes and worker nodes. The master node runs the Kubernetes control plane, which is responsible for the management of the worker nodes, makes scheduling decisions, and implements changes to drive the cluster to a desired state. The worker nodes, as the name implies, they run the workloads and Pod on them.
As is shown in the graph, there are four components running in the Kubernetes control plane, each of them is critical for running a healthy Kubernetes cluster, they act as the different roles within the cluster:</description>

      <description>Porter, a load balancer developed for bare metal Kubernetes clusters, was officially included in CNCF Landscape last week. This marks a great milestone for its parent project KubeSphere as it continues to deliver cloud native technologies to the wider community.
Cloud Native Computing Foundation, or CNCF, was built for the establishment of sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software. Its Interactive Landscape is dynamically generated, serving as a technology roadmap for various industries.</description>
