      <description>Vision Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for deploying containerized applications at scale in private, public and hybrid cloud environments. However, many people can easily get confused when they start to use Kubernetes as it is complicated and has many additional components to manage. Some components need to be installed and deployed by users themselves, such as storage and network services. At present, Kubernetes only provides open-source solutions or projects, which can be difficult to install, maintain and operate to some extent.</description>

      <description>KubeSphere is applicable in a variety of scenarios. For enterprises that deploy their business system on bare metal, their business modules are tightly coupled with each other. That means it is extremely difficult for resources to be horizontally scaled. In this connection, KubeSphere provides enterprises with containerized environments with a complete set of features for management and operation. It empowers enterprises to rise to the challenges in the middle of their digital transformation, including agile software development, automated operation and maintenance, microservices governance, traffic management, autoscaling, high availability, as well as DevOps and CI/CD.</description>

      <description>As part of KubeSphere&amp;rsquo;s commitment to provide a plug-and-play architecture for users, it can be easily installed on existing Kubernetes clusters. More specifically, KubeSphere can be deployed on Kubernetes either hosted on clouds (e.g. AWS EKS, QingCloud QKE and Google GKE) or on-premises. This is because KubeSphere does not hack Kubernetes itself. It only interacts with the Kubernetes API to manage Kubernetes cluster resources. In other words, KubeSphere can be installed on any native Kubernetes cluster and Kubernetes distribution.</description>

      <description>In a production environment, a single-node cluster cannot satisfy most of the needs as the cluster has limited resources with insufficient compute capabilities. Thus, single-node clusters are not recommended for large-scale data processing. Besides, a cluster of this kind is not available with high availability as it only has one node. On the other hand, a multi-node architecture is the most common and preferred choice in terms of application deployment and distribution.</description>

      <description>Overview Persistence volume is Must for Kubesphere. So before installation of Kubesphere, one default StorageClass and corresponding storage plugin should be installed on the Kubernetes cluster. As different users may choose different storage plugin, KubeKey supports to install storage plugin by the way of add-on. This passage will introduce add-on configuration for some mainly used storage plugin.
QingCloud-CSI QingCloud-CSI plugin implements an interface between CSI-enabled Container Orchestrator (CO) and the disk of QingCloud.</description>

      <description>Before You Begin Technically, you can either install and manage Kubernetes yourself or adopt a managed Kubernetes solution. If you are looking for a hands-off approach to taking advantage of Kubernetes, a fully-managed platform solution may suit you best. Please see Deploy KubeSphere on AKS for more details. However, if you want a bit more control over your configuration and set up a highly-available cluster on Azure, this instruction will help you to create a production-ready Kubernetes and KubeSphere cluster.</description>

      <description>Introduction For a production environment, we need to consider the high availability of the cluster. If the key components (e.g. kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, and kube-controller-manager) are all running on the same master node, Kubernetes and KubeSphere will be unavailable once the master node goes down. Therefore, we need to set up a high-availability cluster by provisioning load balancers with multiple master nodes. You can use any cloud load balancer, or any hardware load balancer (e.</description>

      <description>Today, it&amp;rsquo;s very common for organizations to run and manage multiple Kubernetes Clusters on different cloud providers or infrastructures. Each Kubernetes cluster is a relatively self-contained unit. And the upstream community is struggling to research and develop the multi-cluster management solution, such as kubefed.
The most common use cases in multi-cluster management including service traffic load balancing, development and production isolation, decoupling of data processing and data storage, cross-cloud backup and disaster recovery, flexible allocation of computing resources, low latency access with cross-region services, and no vendor lock-in, etc.</description>

      <description>When you use KubeSphere for a certain time, most likely you need to scale out your cluster with workloads increasing. In this scenario, KubeSphere provides script to add new nodes to the cluster. Fundamentally the operation is based on Kubelet&amp;rsquo;s registration mechanism, i.e., the new nodes will automatically join the existing Kubernetes cluster.
Tip
From v3.0.0, the brand-new installer KubeKey supports scale master amd worker node from a sing-node (all-in-one) cluster.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites You have already installed at least two KubeSphere clusters, please refer to Installing on Linux or Installing on Kubernetes if not yet.
Note
Multi-cluster management requires Kubesphere to be installed on the target clusters. If you have an existing cluster, please install a minimal KubeSphere on it as an agent, see Installing Minimal KubeSphere on Kubernetes for details.  Direct Connection If the kube-apiserver address of Member Cluster (hereafter referred to as M Cluster) is accessible on any node of the Host Cluster (hereafter referred to as H Cluster), you can adopt Direction Connection.</description>

      <description>The multi-cluster feature relates to the network connection among multiple clusters. Therefore, it is important to understand the topological relations of clusters as the workload can be reduced.
Before you use the multi-cluster feature, you need to create a Host Cluster (hereafter referred to as H Cluster), which is actually a KubeSphere cluster that has enabled the multi-cluster feature. All the clusters managed by the H Cluster are called Member Cluster (hereafter referred to as M Cluster).</description>

      <description>Cordon a Node Marking a node as unschedulable prevents the scheduler from placing new pods onto that Node, but does not affect existing Pods on the Node. This is useful as a preparatory step before a node reboot or other maintenance.
To mark a Node unschedulable, you can choose Nodes → Cluster Nodes from the menu, then find a node you want to remove from the cluster and click the Cordon button.</description>

      <description>What are KubeSphere Events KubeSphere events allow users to keep track of what is happening inside a cluster, such as node scheduling status and image pulling result. They will be accurately recorded with the specific reason, status and message displayed in the web console. To query events, users can quickly launch the web Toolkit and enter related information in the search bar with different filters (e.g keyword and project) available. Events can also be archived to third-party tools, such as Elasticsearch, Kafka or Fluentd.</description>

      <guid>https://kubesphere.eu/docs/pluggable-components/alerting-notification/</guid>
      <description>What are KubeSphere Alerting and Notification Alerting and Notification are two important building blocks of observability, closely related monitoring and logging. The alerting system in KubeSphere, coupled with the proactive failure notification system, allows users to know activities of interest based on alert policies. When a predefined threshold of a certain metric is reached, an alert will be sent to preconfigured recipients, the notification method of which can be set by yourself, including Email, WeChat Work and Slack.</description>

      <guid>https://kubesphere.eu/docs/pluggable-components/network-policy/</guid>
      <description>What is Network Policy Starting from v3.0.0, users can configure network policies of native Kubernetes in KubeSphere. Network Policies are an application-centric construct, enabling you to specify how a pod is allowed to communicate with various network entities over the network. With network policies, users can achieve network isolation within the same cluster, which means firewalls can be set up between certain instances (pods).
Note
 Please make sure that the CNI network plugin used by the cluster supports Network Policies before you enable it.</description>

      <title>Cloud Native Observability: Log Management</title>
      <link>https://kubesphere.eu/conferences/logging/</link>

      <guid>https://kubesphere.eu/conferences/logging/</guid>
      <description>As logs often contain very valuable information, log management represents an important part of cloud native observability. Logs feature a standard output (stdout) in containers and Kubernetes, which is different from physical machines or virtual machines. This means the collection, analysis and management of logs at the platform level can be carried out in a unified fashion, which demonstrates the unique value of logs. This article introduces a major solution to log management (EFK) in the cloud native area, FluentBit Operator developed by the KubeSphere team and some practices of KubeSphere in multi-tenant log management.</description>

      <description>Many users will transfer their apps to Kubernetes, where storage underlies applications. As users deploy their apps on the Kubernetes, some existing storage plugins are unable to satisfy the growing needs in terms of both diversity and functionality. This is why we need to accelerate the development of new storage plugins, and integrate QingCloud storage services with Kubernetes and KubeSphere.
Kubernetes Storage Plugin Classification In this article, we will focus on the development practices of Kubernetes storage plugins based on CSI.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Kubernetes Control Plane In a Kubernetes cluster, there are two machines roles including master nodes and worker nodes. The master node runs the Kubernetes control plane, which is responsible for the management of the worker nodes, makes scheduling decisions, and implements changes to drive the cluster to a desired state. The worker nodes, as the name implies, they run the workloads and Pod on them.
As is shown in the graph, there are four components running in the Kubernetes control plane, each of them is critical for running a healthy Kubernetes cluster, they act as the different roles within the cluster:</description>

      <description>We know that we can use the service of LoadBalancer in the Kubernetes cluster to expose backend workloads externally. Cloud providers often offer cloud LoadBalancer plugins, which requires the cluster to be deployed on a specific IaaS platform. However, many enterprise users often deploy the Kubernetes cluster on bare metal, especially when it is used for the production environment. For the local bare metal cluster, Kubernetes does not provide LB implementation.</description>
